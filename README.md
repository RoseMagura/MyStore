# Mystore

This is an Angular and Typescript-based e-commerce application. Users
can browse items, add them to the cart, and checkout with an easy-to-use
form. This project uses the data.json provided through Udacity to load
the products available. 

Users can easily navigate through this single-page application by using
either URL endpoints or the various convenient buttons. 

This project requires the latest version of Node and npm.

## Installation

To install, just run `npm install` in the Node terminal. This will 
download all of the necessary dependencies.

## Running Development server

To run the Mystore application, use `ng serve --open` in a terminal.
The `--open` flag is optional and will open the app in your default 
browser. If you wish to open it manually, just enter 
`http://localhost:4200/` into your browser of choice. It will reload
whenever you change the files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

Note: Unit tests are not currently implemented for this project.
